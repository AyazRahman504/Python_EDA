## üìö Objective 
The objective of this assignment is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset using big data tools and techniques. EDA is a critical step in understanding the characteristics of a dataset and uncovering insights that can inform further analysis and decision-making.

## 1. Dataset Selection
Our chosen dataset covers hourly weather data from 623 inmet weathers stations of Brazil.
The dataset that we chose can be retrived through this link [Climate Weather Surface of Brazil - Hourly](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region).

## 2. Data Acquisition
The data is conveniently accessible for processing as it is already formatted in CSV.

## 3. Setting Up the Environment
## Import the necessary libraries
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import gc
import glob
import os

import random
from sys import getsizeof

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Load the Dataset
Here are the methods for directly accessing datasets from Kaggle:

1. Login to your [kaggle.com](www.kaggle.com) account.
2. On the top right of the page, you can see your profile. Click on the profile, you will then see an option to view **Your Profile**, **Settings** and **Sign Out**.
3. Click on the **Settings** button, which is indicated by a gear icon.

**Figure 2: Display your Account Settings.**
</div>

5. You will then be given a JSON file named kaggle.json, which contains the API Key, which is unique to your account and must not be shared.
6. Upload the **kaggle.json** file on Google Drive.

**Figure 3: Display the uploaded kaggle.json file into Drive.**
</div>

7. After the file have been uploaded, use the following command to mount your drive storage on your new colab notebook:

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
8. You will be requested to grant access to your drive storage by selecting your preferred account.
9. Install the required libraries and run the below script :
```
!pip install -q kaggle
!pip install -q kaggle-cli
```

```
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/kaggle.json" ~/.kaggle/
!cat ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```
10. To access the dataset, run the following command:
‚Ä¢ Copy the link after **dataset** keyword.

**Figure 5: Shows the dataset link.**
</div>

```
!kaggle datasets download -d PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region
```
‚Ä¢ Extract the file contents by using this command:
```
!unzip /content/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region.zip
```
