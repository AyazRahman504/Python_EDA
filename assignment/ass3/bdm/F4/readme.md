## Introduction
YouTube maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, ‚ÄúTo determine the year‚Äôs top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes).

This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the IN, US, GB, DE, CA, FR, RU, BR, MX, KR, and JP regions (India, USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and, Japan respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

## Task Overview
1. **Dataset Selection**:
YouTube Trending Video Dataset Analysis

3. **Loading the Dataset**:
Dataset was imported from Kaggle using API.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. This includes checking for missing values, understanding the data types, and getting a sense of the dataset's structure.Perform Univariate Analysis followed by Bivariate Analysis. Things we were able to find doing EDA on the chosen dataset:
* A random 2 dataset from different region were selected to get a column overview. (BR&CA)
* Both random daatset showed same outline with 16 columns.
  - 11 Regions Abbreviation
  - IN = India
  - US = USA
  - GB = Great Britain
  - DE = Germany
  - CA = Canada
  - FR = France
  - RU = Russia
  - BR = Brazil
  - MX = Mexico
  - KR = South Korea
  - JP = Japan
* Dataset Merging
* Handling Missing Value
* Handling Duplicated Value
* Data Type Transformation
* Univariable Analysis
    - ( video_id, title, publishedAt, channelID, channelTitle, categoryId, trending_date, tags, view_count,likes, dislikes, comment_count,thumbnail_link,comments_disable,  ratings_disable , description)

4. **Visualization**:
Visualize the transformed data to gain insights into feature distributions and relationships.

6. ** EDA Question**:
     - What is the top 3 ranking video in each region ?
     - What is the top 3 likes video in each region ?
     - What is the top 3 dislike count video in each region ?
     - What is the top 3 comment count video in each region ?
     - What are the top 10 most viewed channel title?
     - What is the top 10 most frequent type of video in trending?
     - What are the top 10 most commonly used tags in videos which has high views?
  

## Conclusion 
This project mainly focus to identify the trending videos, channel, type in different region and country so that we can know the public preference and create more trending videos.

From the above practice, we know that

BTS and BlackPink are worldwide well-known. Their videos are in the top 3 ranking video, both most like and dislike videos, and in top 3 most comments video.
The top view channel is HYBE LABELS.
Most popular type of video is entertainment video
Most commonly used tags is funny.
