Pandas Profiling is a Python library that simplifies and enhances exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset through integration with the Pandas library. It produces a detailed HTML report containing diverse visualizations and insights, aiding in the comprehension of your data's organization, distribution, and interdependencies.

# HOSPITAL CASE STUDY USING PANDAS PROFILING EDA
The dataset is about the number of peoples that are admitted in the hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic in each of the state in Malaysia. The data set is from GitHub dataset. We are trying to analyse the correlation of the availability the beds and number of occupied beds for COVID-19 patient. We also using the Pandas Profiling EDA to generate a dashboard.

## 1. Selecting Automated EDA Tools



*   Pandas-Profiling is a Python library that provides an easy way to perform automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a DataFrame using the popular Pandas library. It generates a detailed profile report that includes a variety of statistics, visualizations, and insights about the dataset. Here's a brief overview of the key features of pandas-profiling:
