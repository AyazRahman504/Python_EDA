## Task Overview
1. **Dataset Selection**:
    Used car dataset

3. **Loading the Dataset**:
   Dataset was imported from Kaggle using API.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   Perform a basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. This includes
   - checking for missing values
   - understanding the data types
   - Removing duplicated data
   - getting a sense of the dataset's structure.
   - Univariable Analysia
   - EDA question


8. **Feature Engineering with Automated Tools**:
    - Featuretools
    - TPOT

10. **Feature Selection**:
    After generating new features with automated tools, select the most relevant ones for your analysis. You can use techniques like feature importance or domain knowledge to choose the most important features.
    - Features were mostly selected based on correlation value

12. **Visualization**: Visualize the transformed and newly created features to gain insights into their distributions and relationships with the target variable.

13. **Conclusion**:
    - Summarize your findingd on automated feature engineering tools
    - The feature engineering steps have taken with automated tools
    - Feature decision
    - Benefit of automated feature engineering tools.
